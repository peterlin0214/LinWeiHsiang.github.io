															<ul class="Challenges">
																<li>- Recruiting Volunteers<br />
																&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;200 volunteers were required and trained in 60 days</li>
																<li>- Scheduling & Coordination<br />
																&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;30+ tasks, including lots of cross department collaborations</li>
																<li>- Funding <br />
																&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raised NT$100,000 funding in 100 days </li>
															</ul>
														<li class="sub_title">Campaign Organizing</li>
														<p class="text_justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the leader of activity department of 1st National Workshop. I had systematically planned the campaign from recruiting volunteers to interviewing, training and assigning with the help of mindmap and other tools.</p>
															<ol>
																<li>Classification<br />
																<p class="text_justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Identified different functions required to facilitate the campaign</p></li>
																<li>Recruiting<br />
																<p class="text_justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Used multiple channels and storytelling ability to share our value and attract volunteers</p></li>
																<li>Training<br />
																<p class="text_justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Communicated with volunteers to explain the core value of the campaign and guided them to be well-prepared with some limitations and flexibility.
																</p></li> 
															</ol>
														<p class="text_justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turned out we successfully recruited 200+ sharing volunteers and 60+ administration volunteers. It was quite a challenge to organize from the circulation, the time control, to so many factors that might affect the event. Most importantly, I had to take all potential risk into consideration and came up with backup plans.</p>
														<p class="text_justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was selected to be coordinator of 2nd National Workshop, which was much bigger in scale than the first one. With more activities and marketing projects, I applied some operation management skills to help me cooperate with each department and make a good control on the schedule.</p>
															<ol>
																<li>WBS<br />
																<p class="text_justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We used brainstorming and Work Breakdown Structure to identify all necessary activities</p></li>
																<li>Gantt Chart<br />
																<p class="text_justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
																Next, we drew the dependency relationships between activities and estimated duration and possible deviation to find the critical path and the bottleneck.</p></li>
																<li>RAM<br />
																<p class="text_justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I assigned each activity to different departments and used Responsibility Assignment Matrix to help each department stay on track and well-communicated with each other</p></li> 
															</ol> 
														<p class="text_justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a nice experience making theories I learned into practice. There were 1200+ students participating with highly satisfied questionnaire responses.</p><br />

														<li class="sub_title">Public Relationship & Funding</li>
														<p class="text_justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
														As the 1st National Workshop, My team and I managed to contact 300+ senior and vocational schools to promote the event. In the end, we had 20+ schools that made initiative contact with us at the 2nd National Workshop.</p>
														<p class="text_justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
														On the other hand, we came up with an idea to invite youtubers and well-known educators, those were popular among students and had great impacts on society. By this means, we made a win-win situation that the speaker could promote their latest publications or campaigns to increase popularity, at the same time, we could attract more students to the Workshop.</p>
														<p class="text_justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
														Furthermore, we also invited some overseas-study consultants and learning centers to sponsor our Workshop and let them having a speech in return.</p> 
														<p class="text_justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
														One interesting thing is that most of our invited speakers become much more popular these days, like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeo3JwE3HezUWFdVcehQk9Q">RD English</a></p>

														<p>Challenges</p>
														<ul class="Challenges">
															<li>- Attracting Target Audience<br />
															&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without previous fan page, blog or other resources</li>
															<li>- Promoting Campaign<br />
															&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1000+ high school students participation goal</li>
															<li>- Building Partnership with Schools<br />
															&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contacted all the schools in Taiwan without government supports</li>
														</ul>
														<li class="sub_title">Skyrocket our Followers</li>
														<p class="text_justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
														How to attract students to participate was one of the most critical issues. At that time, Facebook was still used by most high school students. Thus, we started our fan page literally from zero to one, actually, from 0 to 5000+ fans in less than three months.</p>
														<p class="text_justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
														How did we pull this off? Articles regarding colleges and departments information were not attractive enough. I thought about what students needed the most before college entrance examination. The answer was recommended notes and test-answering tips.</p>
														<p class="text_justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
														However, we still wanted to let students understand this fan page was mainly for schools' information. Thus, we posted one article about examination notes or skills and posted one about different majors or universities the next day. We started this project sixty days before college-entrance examination. Meanwhile, we also applied some methods, such as, tag your friend or like and follow our fan page, and the student could message us to ask two questions if they did so.</p>
														<p class="text_justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
														Besides the fan page, we also built a blog to post and collect full interviews and exam-tips. We kept our fan page looking simple and easy-to-read. For those who wanted more information, they could click the link to visit our blog. This also helped make SEO and fan page advertising easier.</p>
														<p class="text_justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
														These were some of the marketing strategies we used. There are more interesting stories could be told.</p>
														<p style="text-align: center;">

													 	<li class="sub_title">Win-Win-Win Promotion</li>
														<p class="text_justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
														National Workshop was a big event, so as a huge platform that contained commercial potentials. As mentioned before, we invited some institutions to sponsor our workshop. We did more than just being funded but built collaboration opportunities. By using fan page and posters delivered to high schools, we increased participation, at the same time, promoted our sponsors and workshop as well.</p>
														<p class="text_justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
														On the other hand, we built a keynote speech with series of lectures. Our sponsor could give away there publications, and we would give certificates to students participating those lectures. By all these means, students benefited more and sponsor gained exposure with better engagement.

												<li><h5>Finance</h5>
													<ul>
														<li class="sub_title">Budgeting</li>
														<p class="text_justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
														Creating annual budgets without previous finance data meant I had to consider annual business plans and related financial activities in close collaboration with the development department and other parties. For example, business development department might have planned to join five exhibitions. By establishing a clear roadmap of what and how we were going to do, I could estimate the revenue and expense and come up with a reasonable annual budget.  
														<br /><br />
														<ol>
															<li>Zero-Based Budgeting
																<p class="text_justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
																It is obvious that traditional budgeting might not be the best way to create our annual budget, since there was no historical data. Even there was, the financial activities might shift from year to year as the business environment was full of uncertainty. Thus, I used zero-based budgeting as the baseline of annual budget. This was a little time-consuming. However, the budget could better reflect the priority corresponding to our annual business plan.
																</p>
															</li>
															<li>Activity-Based Budgeting
																<p class="text_justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Activity-based budgeting was applied after we got some basic data, indicating the allocator(cost driver) regarding their corresponding business activities, or somethings we called "direct cost" . For example, labor-hour was the cost driver to salary and wages expenses. However, this was just a roughly explanation. To be more precise, the activity-based budgeting was mainly used to set the budget with "revenue-generating" activities.</p>
																<p class="text_justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
																Thus, classifying business activities into revenue-generating and operating-related categories was the step taken before budgeting. Then, we could calculate the cost per unit by dividing the total cost to the total units of the allocator. After estimating the units required to the future business activities based on our business plans, I could set our budget more precisely. This also helped with the financial analysis in the later part.</p>
																<p class="text_justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
																As for the budget of operations side, it included two parts, the indirect costs, which actually have something to do with the revenue-generating activities, and normal operating costs, which were mainly fixed. The indirect costs were estimated to be ratio of direct costs. The indirect costs were relatively hard to be accurately predicted and should be carefully considered.</p>
																<p class="text_justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I could come up with a budgeted income statement. 
																</p> 
															</li>
															<li>Budget Tolerance Limit
																<p class="text_justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creating a solid budget was important. However, with the ever-changing environment, I needed to set budget tolerance limit, primary based on the maximum risk we could take and some data regarding the cost driver we collected, such as the mean value and the deviation of travel expense per trip, to set the tolerance limit for the business trips, for example.</p>
																<p class="text_justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were two factors that might affect the precision of the budget, the cost per unit and the units it took as we predicted the business activities. Also, some business activities might cause indirect cost, which was hard to be accurately estimated.</p>
															</li>											
															<li>Budget Adjustment
																<p class="text_justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another part of budgeting is making adjustment after a period. But first, I had to evaluate and truly understand the performance to make sure the calculation wouldn't be conducted with bias. For example, the utilities expense might be based on a ratio to the total labor hours. A real expense less than expected might not be caused due to a overestimated ratio. Though the total labor hours might be just the same as we predicted, our team could have a ten-day business trip, leaving our office underutilized.</p> 
																<p class="text_justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After examining the meaning and possible reason behind the mis-predicted budget, I could use the data to recalculate the unit cost or the units required to the related activities and adjust the future budget.
																</p>
															</li>
														</ol>

														<li class="sub_title">Accounting</li>
														<p class="text_justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
														The technical know-how, funding, and the operations team may be the most crucial elements for a startup. However, financial management could play as a equally important role. And a well performed financial management could not be conducted without a precision accounting system.  
														</p><br />
														<ol>
															<li>Managerial Accounting
																<p class="text_justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
																Accounting sounds to be the easiest part for the small business, and that's why it is often neglected. However, this is a critical part. Without comprehensively documented transaction records, it will be hard to conduct other  financial management tasks, such as financial analysis and budgeting.</p>
																<p class="text_justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
																My job was to stick to managerial accounting to make sure all financial activities were properly recorded. Thus, these data could be prepared for further analysis and decision making. Some of the challenge included how to classify direct and indirect cost. Sometimes, the same activities could serve for different purposes, making the boundary vague. 
																</p>
															</li>
														</ol>

														<li class="sub_title">Financial Analysis</li>
														<p class="text_justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
														The financial analysis was the key component of measuring our business performance. The analysis was conducted mainly through the following methods.  
														</p><br/>
														<ol>
															<li>Vertical Analysis 
																<p class="text_justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
																Through analyzing and comparing the real financial situation to the expected one through income statement, I could evaluate the business performance, identify potential risks, and have a better understanding of the cost structure to refine the under-estimated or over-estimated situations. It was important not just looking at the differences between estimation and real-performance but also finding out the reasons behind. Also, it should be conducted with horizontal analysis before making conclusion. I would show an example at the following "horizontal analysis" section.     
																</p>
															</li>
															<li>Horizontal  Analysis
																<p class="text_justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
																The horizontal analysis provided the basic and intuitive insights of the trend, as well as the opportunities and risks. It was crucial to take the previous periods into consideration while evaluate the business performance. For example, the material, supplies, and wages expense regarding R&D department could be higher during and after the months when we attended exhibitions. The extra expense was resulted from the cases under evaluation and development, which not yet be done and counted as "unearned revenue".
																</p>
																<p class="text_justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
																The vertical and horizontal analysis also interacted with the budgeting adjustment. For example, the utilities expense was correlated with labor hours with certain ratio, which meant using labor hour as allocator was not a problem. However, if the utilities expenses were all much higher than budgets under different labor hours, we must recalculate the indirect cost rate to adjust our budgeting. On the other hand, if there were expenses less than budgets without affecting operating performance, it might indicate there were idle capacities.
																</p>
															</li>
															<li>Project Analysis
																<p class="text_justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
																As our products were software solutions, it was relatively simple for analysis compared to retailers or companies managing inventories. On the other hand, the development cost was the fundamental and critical part as analyzing the business performance. Since every case required different duration and resources, one of my job was to carefully analyze the performance of each project. This went back to the issue to properly allocated the indirect cost hidden behind the business activities.
																</p>
															</li>
															<li> Other Critical Index
																<p class="text_justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
																Analyses about liquidity and other critical index were conducted as well. However, it was not the major part of the financial management tasks. 
															</li>        
															<li>Alternative Plans
																<p class="text_justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Budgeting and financial analysis were just basic guideline for the upcoming operation. However, what if the performance was just not good enough to generate necessary cash flow? Should we increase more spending on advertisement and other exposure events, or cut the spending down? When we planned our annual budget, we had a process kind like decision tree and sensitive analysis. Thus, When the performance was severely detached from our expectation, we would consider changing our original plan.
																</p>
																<p class="text_justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still, all decisions should be made with sufficient analysis. Most of the time we would be more cautious with spending. Beyond, it was necessary to have well-informed and comprehensive discussions between inner and outer stakeholders. Most importantly, keeping the team members, including myself, from bias decisions due to polarized team discussion and insufficient and reckless encapsulation.

														</li>
														<p class="text_justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
														The key of B2B sales is to reach those who have decision power. However, it's not easy, especially making contact with big corporates. The hierarchy structures of big corporates are complicated and it took time for message to go through. Thus, we tried to find out effective ways to reach the key contact person, and exhibition was a great option of making direct contacts.</p>
														<p class="text_justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
														We first searched all corporates with AOI products or in related fields to list the exhibitions they had participated. During this process, we also discovered more information about the<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1fsIKUAnX3vAF1CZrTMAPDFqv6ED3fOxMLc_pHKz-ESk">industry</a> and other <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1LT4aaPWS3GG3bNqpOSmSJPfL9xfAvFU0AT8HOmrbusg">exposure channels.</a></p>
														<p class="text_justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
														After we listed the exhibitions we were interested in, I went further to analyze the data, such as visitors' and exhibitors' composition, number and purchase probability, and of course the fee and other basic information to chose the best-suited exhibitions.</p>
														<p style="text-align: center;">
															<img class="elements_img" src="images/exhibitions.png">
														</p>    
														<p class="text_justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
														We started a series of exhibitions since April 2017 and kept reviewing after each time to do it better. Also, I established a Customer Relationship Management(CRM) system and applied some analytics methodologies to detect the affecting factors.</p>
														<p class="text_justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
														We had created more than 500 marketing qualified leads and 120+ sales qualified leads in one year. Even now, our sales are mainly from exhibitions and references from existing customers.</p>
														<p style="text-align: center;">

														</p>   
									
														<li class="sub_title">Other Activity
														</li>
														<p class="text_justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
														Besides participating exhibitions, email marketing was the primary tool we used to approach new clients and keep in touch with our clients. The official website and fan page were also used to generate more awareness and interest.</p>
														<p class="text_justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We sent mails to not only visitors but also exhibitors requiring AOI or automated QC solutions. We used web crawler to gather information of exhibitors who already attended those exhibitions and invited them to our booth. Also, we gathered information from HR agency and provided solutions to the companies recruiting AOI or QC engineers.

												<li><h5>Others</h5>
													<ul>
														<li class="sub_title">SBIR Project</li>
														<p class="text_justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
														SBIR stands for Small Business Innovation Research program. It's a government-held program to strengthen SMEs new technologies development by funding part of the development project. It's not easy to be qualified because it examines not only the technical parts but also other aspects.</p>     
														<p class="text_justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
														Several things were taken into consideration before approval, such as innovation, competitiveness, and feasibility. Thus, we needed to provide a sophisticating planning from technical aspect to tactical aspect.</p>
														<p class="text_justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After approved, lots of reports regarding KPI and accounting were required. That was a test for me to make sure the project was on the track and every details were properly done and documented. 
														</p>

														<li class="sub_title">Golden Torch Award</li>
														<p class="text_justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golden Torch Award was another approval for us. It was selected annually to commend well-performed companies, innovative technology and extraordinary corporate leaders. We were lucky to be selected as top 10 potential companies and top 10 potential products at 2017.

														<p>Challenges</p>
															<ul class="Challenges">
																<li>- No Experience in "Mahjong"<br />
																&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had to help design backstage of mahjong game while I hadn't played it before.</li>
																<li>- Uncertain Revenue Model<br />
																&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I needed to figure out how to attract and gain dealers with easy-understanding model.</li>
															</ul>
														<li class="sub_title">Revenue model design</li>
														<p class="text_justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our business model was using <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1WRC_psxTxnt4a4g6r57ZrNB1M-VVL--f">"Player Room"</a> mechanism to achieve viral marketing among mahjong players and sell "Room Card" to create revenue. Main competitors, such as <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.gamesofa.com/mj/">"神來也"</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.gametower.com.tw/Games/FreePlay/Mj/star31/">“明星三缺一”</a>, were featuring quick match game. However, there were players seeking more "realistic" playing experience and preferring to play with friends instead of computer players.</p>  
														<p class="text_justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With some <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1kUGPUlWjunFlwtjZrGurBsZy80oXO11S">market surveys</a>showing those highly addicted players were around the age of 40~50 and had strong connections among their friends, who also played mahjong, I targeted those players and tried to design a revenue model that would fit our business model.</p>
														<p class="text_justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were two primary designs, multilevel direct selling and pyramid structure.
														</p>		
															<p class="inner_content">
																<p style="text-align: center;">
																	<img class="elements_img" src="images/dealer_structure.png">
																</p>
																<ol>
																	<li>Multilevel direct selling<br />
																	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This mechanism is familiar to many people in Taiwan. The bonus sound attractive. However, there were problems along with its benefits. 
																		<ul style="margin-top: 10px">
																			<li>Agents might stockpile goods(game cards) and cause unstable cash flow.</li>
																			<li>Direct selling had had bad reputation and been associated with fraud.</li>
																			<li>Backstage would be more complicated due to different bonus calculation within the multiple-level structure.</li>	
																		</ul>				
																	</li>
																	<li>Dealer pyramid<br />
																	<p class="text_justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This structure was better fitted to our business model. We generally divided our structure into three layers. The bottom were agents, who bought room cards from dealers, or the company if there were no corresponding dealers. The middle layer were dealers, who took greater discount from the company and sold game cards to agents.</p>
																	<p class="text_justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make this easier to understand, we simply used "gold dealer" and "silver dealer" to represent agent and dealer mentioned above.By applying this structure, there were some benefits.</p>
																		<ul style="margin-top: 10px">
																			<li>Dealers of each stage could focus on their roles.</li>
																			<p class="text_justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
																			Silver dealers had more margin profits; however, they had to deal with customer issues and acted like CSRs. Because players(end-users) were their income sources, they would focus on how to attract more players and stimulate more consumption.</p>  
																			<p class="text_justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
																			On the other hand, gold dealers' profits came from play cards sold to silver dealers. Thus, they would focus on how to promote more players to become silver dealers. Because gold dealers got to be silver dealers at the first place, they knew what kind of obstacles silver dealers might encounter and acted like mentors.   
																			</p>
																			<li>Dealers can chose their positions</li>
																			<p class="text_justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
																			Dealers had to meet certain requirements to go to upper stage. However, we concerned that some dealers might prefer and suit particular stage. Thus, we allowed dealers that is qualified to stay at their original stage. This mechanism helped every dealer to perform better. For example, one could be qualified to move from silver dealer to golden, which spent much less time and effort to deal with players. However, if the dealer was passionate about developing new players, he could chose not to become golden dealer. However, each dealer could only have one identity at one time.
																			</p> 
																			<li>Backstage would be more simple.</li>
																			<p class="text_justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
																			We didn't have much time to modify the backstage structure. By adopting pyramid structure, our backstage would be simple for dealer. They could view how many cards are in stock, how many cards have been sold to whom within specific duration. Dealers just needed to buy cards from upper dealer and control their stocks. Their profits could be easily calculated. This was a benefit for not only dealers but also the company.
																			</p>
																			<li>Avoid stocking</li>
																			<p class="text_justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
																			In traditional direct selling structure, since the bonus is given once the product is sold by subordinates, some would even force their subordinates to stock products, or even create subordinates account that are actually themselves. By contrast, because dealers' profit was gain by margin between cost and revenue, there would be no way to create additional profit by stocking products. This also helped us to have a better control of selling activities. 
																			</li>	

																		</ul>		
																	</li>
																</ol>
															</p>
										
														<li class="sub_title">Backstage Design</li>
														<p class="text_justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After surveying our target audience, we realized must of them were at the age between 40~45. Taking the user experience into consideration, I designed the backstage buttons to provide necessary functions as less confusing as possible. The original backstage had 27 buttons for dealers. I managed to reduce them to 18. It was not just downsizing the framework but also being aware of what users, including administrator and dealers, might need. It took many steps and refines to come up with the final solution.</p>

														<p class="inner_content">
															<ol>
																<li>What business goals do stakeholders concern?</li>
																<p class="text_justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
																Just like data science, in which the first step is to understand the problems aimed to solve, the first step of designing what buttons were needed was to list crucial business goals(or problems) with priority.</p>
																<li>What methods should be used to help gain insights and decision makings?</li>
																<p class="text_justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
																After listing the business goals being concerned, the next step was figuring out what kinds of methods or measurements could help stakeholders with decision making to achieve certain business goals.
																</p>
																<li>What data are required</li>
																<p  class="text_justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
																The last step before designing buttons was to think over the data required to facilitate the measurements.</p>
																<p style="text-align: center;">
																	<img class="elements_img" src="images/button_design.png">
																</p>
																<ul style="margin-top: 10px">
																	<p>For example, the golden dealers might concern the follow problems</p>
																	<li>Find out the main customers(silver dealer)<br />
																	> Accumulated purchase amount of silver dealers within specific duration<br /> 
																	> List sorted by number of cards purchased by silver dealers with duration selection<br />										
																	> Button【 Selling Detail 】<br />
																		<ul class="Challenges" style="margin-bottom: 5px;">
																			<li>Selector(Filter): time duration
																			</li>
																			<li>Output: silver dealer's ID, number of cards purchased, consumption percentage, number of cards consumed 
																			</li>	
																			<li>Order: number of cards purchased, consumption percentage
																			</li>
																		</ul>
																	</li>
																	<li>Solve the stocking issue for silver dealers if there is one.<br /> 
																	> The consumption amount compared to purchase amount<br />  
																	> List sorted by consumption percentage within specific duration.<br />
																	> Button【 Selling Detail 】<br />		
																	</li><br />
																	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the【 Selling Detail 】button above, it came through a series of process. At first, there were two buttons related to each purpose; however, we found out the table could be combined. There were other buttons for checking the general selling situation or with specified silver dealer.
																	</p>
																</ul>	
															</ol>	
														</p>
													</ul>													
												</li>
												<li><h5>Business Development</h5>
													<ul>
														<li class="sub_title">Physical Channel Development</li>
														<p  class="text_justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
														We had roughly surveyed our TA, who preferred physical to virtual playing experience. I came up with an idea to cooperate with board game stores and table game stores, where the players are mostly close friends, which perfectly fitted our TA's characteristics. Stores could chose to be our dealers or simply promoted our games with special QR code we gave to them. Each QR code was unique, so we could track the number of players registered from each store. Also, we gave bonus to those reaching certain number of monthly users. </p>
														<li class="sub_title">Line Group Strategy</li>
														<p  class="text_justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
														Our game was first launched for free and could be downloaded only by APK. We thought using line group would be a good strategy to promote our product. There were some reasons:
															<ul class="inner_ul">
																<li>Easy to Use & Management</li>
																<p class="text_justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
																Line was the most widely used communication APP among our TA. By running line group, silver dealers could teach new players how to download and play. At the same time, silver dealers could hold some activities on their own. Other benefits included dealers could directly respond to any issue raised by players.  
																</p>
																<li>Test & Feedback</li>
																<p class="text_justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the game went online and charged, we collected feedback and tested if their was any bug. As mentioned, our silver dealers could help collect and sort the feedbacks and passed them to us.
																</p>
																<li>Viral Marketing</li>
																<p class="text_justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
																Players could invite their friends into line group. Thus, we expanded the players' networks on the existing relationships, which were already strong connections. Players would talk and share their playing experience with others and make new friends in our line group. This mechanism increased engagement and acted like viral marketing. People kept inviting their friends and created new relationships.

																<li>- Lack of Content<br />
																&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was only fan page as primary marketing tool and it was hard to make explicit positioning.</li>
																<li>- New Market Development<br />
																&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The company wanted to develop new markets with limited clues.</li>
																<li>- Poor Performance of Old Platform.<br />
																&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although we already had many courses on the original website, the conversion rate was far from the company's expectation.</li>
															</ul>
														<li class="sub_title" id="marketing_intern">Marketing Intern</li>
														<p class="text_justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our founder had run a well-known civil-service-examination cram school for a long time and decided to step into the online education industry. Leverage Inc. was simply filming and moving physical courses to the website in the beginning. When I first joined the team, I was assigned to conduct fan page marketing. Besides copywriting on the fan page, I proposed creating blog on the official website to help keep track of conversion rate of each state of the marketing funnel, as well as leverage content marketing.</p>
														<p style="text-align: center;">
															<img class="elements_img" src="images/marketing_funnel.png">
														</p>
															<ol>
																<li>Awareness</li>
																<p class="text_justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
																We used facebook fanpage and google Ads as primary tools.</p>
																<p class="text_justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
																It was important to understand what content will attract TA's awareness in one simple line or few words. Sufficient survey was necessary. Take CCNA(Cisco Certified Network Associate) for example, I used "CCNA, most demanded certification of networking skills?" and "CCNA, The stepping stone to networking field". These titles were made for reasons. TA to CCNA was narrow niche, whose primary concern was how to have a better career and which kinds of certifications were worth the time and efforts. I used google trend and google Ads to better understand the primary expectation of the target customers.         
																</p>
																<li>Interest</li>
																<p class="text_justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
																This was the key to content marketing. Audience could be lost(called churn) once they found the content was not helpful or felt bored. I addressed data, news, and solid information with my storytelling ability. Furthermore, I linked related articles to each other to make it more persuasive, which also helped with the SEO. At the front and bottom of the articles were links to the campaign page. This stage was also the core of SEO. By adding meta-data, title and other techniques to make our blog have better ranking and easier for browser to understand the content of the page. Another crucial concept was searching and surveying the related topics. With some helpful tools, such as google console, we could decided what title and content should be used and focused on.  
																</p>
																<li>Consideration</li>
																<p class="text_justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
																This state required clear and coherent description. I needed to think of what take-away the audience would have. "This is a professional online course", "The price is super appealing" or what else? A simple format of checklist was one of the useful demonstration to customers, which I added at the end of the article to enhance the take-away I expected to convey. Besides copywriting, I communicated with UI/UX engineer to build the campaign page, which might include free trial through submitting contact info to us or other functions to stimulate potential customers going to the next stage.
																</p>
																<li>Intent</li>
																<p class="text_justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
																Although this part was not my job, I still learned a lot from my college about making cold call and other customer engaging skills.
																</p>
															</ol>
														
														<li class="sub_title">Market Research and STP</li>
														<p class="text_justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
														However, it won't be enough to build a online education platform with only a few categories of courses, we needed more diversity. Besides, the performance was unsatisfying to my boss. Hence, I tried to identify the opportunities, predict future trend, and communicate with users and teachers to build a platform with richer content.

															<p>(1) Secondary Research for Taiwan's Online Platforms.</p>
															<p class="text_justify"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
															To answer these questions, I searched articles that listed or recommended some of the online platforms and listed the websites I found. I also found some information regarding how people positioned and thought about these platforms by viewing their responses and comments.</p>
															<p class="text_justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
															There was other information that helped me draw bigger picture about online education, such as<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.epark.org.tw/images/20170207181827image_6.pdf"> Moeaidb's Industry Research Report</a>. I could use this information and trend I found to go back to the searching process. 
															</p>							
															<p>(2) Primary Research for Well-known Platforms</p>
															<p class="text_justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
															After collecting secondary research information, I surveyed their websites, it was easy to list all categories popular in the market, and I could classify these competitors and find out what was their primary focus.</p>
															<p class="text_justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
															On the other hand, I surveyed the comments on competitors' fan pages or course profiles to roughly understand customers' satisfaction toward different course categories among these competitors.         
															</p>
														
															<p>(3) Further Research for Interested Fields.</p>
															<p class="text_justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
															After sorting information above, it showed which learning fields were relatively popular and highly demanded, so I could go futher. There was actually lots of information, for example, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.lttc.ntu.edu.tw/academics/SFLPT_Doc/105%E5%B9%B4_%E7%AC%AC%E4%BA%8C%E5%A4%96%E8%AA%9E%E8%83%BD%E5%8A%9B%E6%B8%AC%E9%A9%97%E5%A0%B1%E5%91%8A.pdf"> Second Foreign Language Test Survey</a>
															</p><br />

															<li>STP&nbsp;(There are some parts of the process that could be <a href="improve.html">improved</a>)
																<p>(1) Market Segmentation</p>
																<p class="text_justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
																I created one matrix with one dimension showing the number of courses provided by competitors with different course categories and another one showing the demand, measured by registration number of the customers and other sources of information, to roughly demonstrate the supply and demand toward each category of course. 
																</p>
																<p>(2) Market Targeting</p>
																<p class="text_justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
																By analyzing competitors' products, market demand and our platform's products, we found out which market segments we should target.</p>
																<p class="text_justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
																To be more specific, the cell in the matrix mentioned above specified the ratio of the demand compared to the ratio of course provided. For example, under the survey, there was 40% of the demand showing interest in computer science related courses and 30% of the courses provided were computer science. Thus, we could have a picture of the market situation. the  The result came out that we targeted language and computer science courses mainly for license test.

																<p class="text_justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was back to my <a href="#marketing_intern">primary work</a> as marketing intern, using content marketing to help with market positioning.     
																</p>
															</li>
														</ol>

														<li class="sub_title" id="associate_pm">Product Development</li>
														<p class="text_justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
														I was glad that my supervisor gave me opportunity, which I was authorized to discover potential instructors and courses, and design new products.</p>
														<p class="text_justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
														My first two courses made were Spanish and front-end development(HTML+CSS+JavaScript). My idea was simple, took myself as a user; however, always took stakeholders' interests and constraints into account. Some analysis were conducted to better understand the customers' needs and market fit.
														<ol>
															<li> Customer Focus </li>
															<p class="text_justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
															To better understand the customers' needs and come up with more satisfying products, I first did some "focus survey", which meant a open-ended question, to draw some ideas about what kind of features might be considered when deciding taking or not taking the online courses. At this stage, I let the interviewers share their experience and the reason they took the courses, as well as what improvement they expected during their experience.</p>
															<p class="text_justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
															The next step was extracting the information from the user experience, changing the qualitative data into quantitative data, and making a list of the features that customers might consider during the purchasing process. After that, a used an online questionnaire with each features was asked to given the weight from 1 to 5. Then a simple ANOVA test was conducted to tell if their was any feature dominate the customers' decision makings.    
															</p>
															<p class="text_justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
															However, some qualitative information that was hard to evaluated was still taken into account during the process of constructing a better product, including the content itself, the course structure and expression, the length of the video, and even the interface. I even learned a little bit about front-end development to find out what obstacles one could face during learning front-end engineering.
															</p>
															<p class="text_justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
															Many things could be added to the products; however, just like STP, part of my job as an associate PM is to figure out the priority and create values which fitted our TA and company's positioning.
															</p>

																</p>
															<p class="text_justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
															The same concept and methodology was applied to help with the redesign of the new website. 
															</p>
															
															<li> Communication </li>
															<p class="text_justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
															Communication couldn't be over emphasized as the most important skill of PM. There were other stakeholders regarding products that I needed to communicate with. For example, the instructor might not want to add or change content while some extra information or more detailed explanation might be significantly helpful. My supervisor might have a three-day deadline while the instructor wanted to revise the content, which took more time than that. Communication was really important because there was always trade-off between budget, time and interests among stakeholders.
															</p>

															<li> Constantly Review & Test </li>
															<p class="text_justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
															It took weeks or even months to build a new course. It would be too late to find out the problems until it was almost done. I had to communicate with instructors before we made videos to share vision about what we expected. Also, I let my friends or colleagues try some of the features during development process to have some responses. It was important to check if we did it in the right way during the process. Constantly review was definitely necessary.
