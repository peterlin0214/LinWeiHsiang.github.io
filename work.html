												<li><h5>National Workshop</h5>
													<ul>
														<p>Challenges</p>
															<ul class="Challenges">
																<li>- Recruiting Volunteers<br />
																&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;200 volunteers were required and trained in 60 days</li>
																<li>- Scheduling & Coordination<br />
																&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;30+ tasks, including lots of cross department cooperation</li>
																<li>- Funding <br />
																&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raised NT$100,000 funding in 100 days </li>
															</ul>
														<li class="sub_title">Campaign Organizing</li>
														<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the leader of activity department of 1st National Workshop. I had systematically planned the campaign from recruiting volunteers to interviewing, trainning and assigning with mindmap and other tools.</p>
															<ol>
																<li>Classification<br />
																&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Identifying different functions required to run the campaign</li>
																<li>Recruiting<br />
																&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using multiple channels and storytelling method to strike a chord and attract volunteers</li>
																<li>Training<br />
																&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Communicating with volunteers to explain core value of the campaign and guided them to be well-prepared with some limitations and flexibility.</li> 
															</ol>
														<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It turned out to successfully recruite 200+ sharing volunteers and 60+ administration volunteers. It was quite a challenge to organize from circulation, time control to so many factors that might affect the event. Most importantly, I had to take all potential risk into consideration and came up with backup plans.</p>
														<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was selected to be coordinator of 2nd National Workshop, which was much bigger in scale than the first one. With more activites and marketing projects, I applied some operation management skills to help me cooperate with each department and make a good schedule control.</p>
															<ol>
																<li>WBS<br />
																&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We used brainstorming and WBS to identify and breakdown all necessary activities</li>
																<li>Gantt Chart<br />
																&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next, we drew the dependency relationships between activities and estimated duration to find critical path.</li>
																<li>RAM<br />
																&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I assigned each activity to different departments and used responsibility assignment matrix to help each department to stay on track and well-communicated with each other</li> 
															</ol> 
														<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a nice experience making theories I learned into practice. There were 1200+ students participating with highly satisfied questionnaire responses.</p><br />

														<li class="sub_title">Public Relationship & Funding</li>
														<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the 1st National Workshop, My team and I managed to contact 300+ senior and vocational high schools to promote the event. This ended up having 20+ schools that made initiative contact with us at 2nd National Workshop.<br /> 
														&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the orher hand, we came up with an idea to invite youtubers and well-known educators, those were popular among students and having great impact on society. By this means, we made a win-win situation that those speaker can promote their latest writings or campaigns to increase popularity, at the same time, we did attract more students to the Workshop.<br />
														&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, we also invited some overseas-study consultants and learning centers to sponsor our Workshop and had their own speech in return.<br /> 
														&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One interesting thing is that most of our invited speaker become much more popular these days, like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeo3JwE3HezUWFdVcehQk9Q">RD English</a></p>

												<li><h5>Fan Page & Marketing</h5>
													<ul>
														<p>Challenges</p>
														<ul class="Challenges">
															<li>- Attracting Target Audience<br />
															&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;without previous fan page, blog or other resources</li>
															<li>- Promoting Campaign<br />
															&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1000+ high school students participation goal</li>
															<li>- Building Partnership with Schools<br />
															&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;contacted all the schools in Taiwan without government support</li>
														</ul>
														<li class="sub_title">Skyrocket Fans</li>
														<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How to attract students to participate was one of the most critical issues. At that time, Facebook was still used by most senior high students. Thus, we started our fan page literally from 0 to 1, actually, from 0 to 5000+ fans in less than 3 months.<br />
														&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How did we pull this off? Articles about colleges and departments were not attractive enough. I thought about what students needed the most before college entrance examination. The answer was recommended notes and test-answering tips.</br />
														&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, we still wanted to let students understand this fan page is mainly for college information. Thus, we posted one article about examination notes or skills and posted article about college the next day. We started this project 60 days before college-entrance examination. As the same time, we also used some methods, such as, tag your firend or like and follow our fan page, and the student could message us to ask two questions.<br />
														&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the fan page, we also built a blog to post and collect full interview and exam-tips. Thus, we kept our fan page looking simple and easy-to-read. For those who wanted more information, they could link to our blog. This also helped make SEO and fan page advertising easier.<br />
														&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are only some of the marketing strategies we used. There are more interesting stories could be told.

													 	</p> 	
													 	<li class="sub_title">Win-Win-Win Promotion</li>
														<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;National Workshop was a big enevt, so as a huge platform that contained commercial potential. As mentioned before, we invieted some instituions to sponsor our workshop. We did more than just funding but built a collaboration opportunity, where by using fan page and posters deliverd to high schools, we increased participation, at the same time, promoted our sponsors so as workshop itself.<br />
														&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, we built a keynote speech with series of lectures. Our sponsor could give away there publications, and we would give certificates to students participating those lectures. By all these means, students benefited more and sponsor gained exposure with higher engagement.

														<p>Challenges</p>
															<ul class="Challenges">
																<li>- Lack of Content<br />
																&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was only fan page as primary marketing tool and it was hard to make brand positioning.</li>
																<li>- New Market Development<br />
																&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Company wanted to exploit new market with few clues.</li>
																<li>- Poor Performance of Old Platform.<br />
																&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although we already had many courses on the website, the conversion rate was far from conpany's expectation.</li>
															</ul>
														<li class="sub_title" id="marketing_intern">Marketing Intern</li>
														<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our founder had run a well-known civil-service-examination cram school for a long time and decided to step into online education. Thus, Leverage Inc. was simply moving classroom coureses to website at the beginning. When I first joined the team, I was assigned to do fan page marketing. Besides copywriting of fan page, I proposed creating blog to help keep track of conversion rate of each state of marketing funnel.
														<p style="text-align: center;">
															<img class="elements_img" src="images/marketing_funnel.png">
														</p>
															<ol>
																<li>Awareness<br />
																&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We used facebook and google Ads as primary tools.<br />
																&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was important to understand what content will attract TA's awareness in one simple line or few words. Sufficient survey was necessary. Take CCNA(Cisco Certified Network Associate) for example, I used "CCNA, most demanded certification in networking industry?" and "CCNA, The stepping stone to networking industry". These titles were made for reasons. TA to CCNA was narrow niche, whose primary concern was how to have a better career and which certificatons were worth the time and efforts.        
																</li>
																<li>Interest<br />
																&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was the key to content marketing. Audience could be lost once they found the content was not helpful or boring. I used to address data, news or more solid information, and if there were chances, the real story to prove the importance or necessity of the products. Furthermore, I would link related articles to each other to make it more persuasive. At the front and bottom of the articles were links to campaign page. This stage was also the core of SEO. By adding meta-data, title and other techniques to make our blog have better ranking. Another crucial concept is searching and surveying related topics. With some helpful tools, such as google console, we could decided what title and content should be used and focused on.  
																</li>
																<li>Consideration<br />
																&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This state required clear and coherent description. I needed to think of what take-away the audience would have. "This is a professional online course", "The price is relatively cheap" or what else? Checklist was one of the useful ways I commonly used. Besides copywriting, I communicated with UI/UX enginner to build the campaign page, which might include leaving contact info for free trial or other function to help go through the next step.
																</li> 
																<li>Intent<br />
																&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although this part was not my job, but I still learned a lot from my college about making cold call and other skills.</li>
															</ol>
												
														<li class="sub_title">Market Research and STP</li>
														<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, it won't be enough to bulid a online education platform simply with few categories of courses, we needed more diversity. Furthermore, the performance was unsatisfying to my boss. Thus, I tried to identify the opportunities, predict future trend and communicate with those teacher to build a platform with richer content.<br />
														&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't think I did my best back at that time. I will show what I did and what I may improve.
														<br /><br />
														&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Market Research
														<ul class="Challenges">
															<li>- How many competitors did we have?</li>
															<li>- What were their main products?</li>
															<li>- What were their differences?</li>
															<li>- Who were their customers?</li>
															<li>- Where were our opportunities?</li>
														</ul>
														&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Secondary Research for Taiwan's Online Platforms.
															<p class="inner_content">
															&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To answer all these questions, I searched articles that listed some online platforms, and used key words to google, then found recommended websites. These also included some inforamtion, such as how people positioned and thought about these platforms.<br />
															&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was other information that helped me draw bigger picture about online education, such as<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.epark.org.tw/images/20170207181827image_6.pdf"> Moeaidb's Industry Research Report</a></p>							
														&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2)
														Primary Research for Well-known Platforms
															<p class="inner_content">
															&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After collecting secondary research information, I surveyed their websites, it was easy to list all categories popular in the market, and I could classify these competitors and find out what was their primary focus.<br />
															&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, I surveyed the comments on competitors' fan pages or course profiles to roughly understand customers' satisfaction toward different course categories among these competitors.         
															</p>
														
														&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Futher Research for Interested Fields.
															<p class="inner_content">		
															&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After sorting information above, it showed which learning fields were relatively popular and highly demanded, so I could go futher. There was actually lots of information, for example, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.lttc.ntu.edu.tw/academics/SFLPT_Doc/105%E5%B9%B4_%E7%AC%AC%E4%BA%8C%E5%A4%96%E8%AA%9E%E8%83%BD%E5%8A%9B%E6%B8%AC%E9%A9%97%E5%A0%B1%E5%91%8A.pdf"> Second Foreign Language Test Survey</a>
															</p><br />
													
														&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. STP<br />
														&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Market Segmentation
															<p class="inner_content">
															&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
															I created two matrixes. One with categories and competitors to showed each platform's main focus. Another one with customers' demand and feedbacks toward each categories within the platforms. 
															</p>
														&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Market Targeting<br />
															<p class="inner_content">
															&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
															By analyzing competitors' products, market demand and our platform's products, we found out which market segments we should target.<br />
															&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result came out that we targeted language and computer science courses mainly for license test.  
															</p>
															<p style="text-align: center;">
																<img class="elements_img" src="images/Leverage_STP.png">
															</p>
														&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Market Positioning
															<p class="inner_content">
															&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was back to my <a href="#marketing_intern">primary work</a> as marketing intern, using content marketing to help with market positioning.     
															</p><br /> 
														</p>
														
														<li class="sub_title" id="associate_pm">Product Development</li>
														<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was glad that my supervisor gave me opportunity, which I was authorized to discover potential instructors and courses, and design new products.<br />
														&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first two courses made were Spanish and front-end development(HTML+CSS+JavaScript). My idea was simple, took myself as a user; however, always took stakeholders' interests and constraints into account.
														<ol>
															<li> Customer Focus <br />
															&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe a good product should satisfy customers' need from many aspects. The content itself, the course structure and expression, the length of each video, and even the interface could affect user experience. I even learned a little bit about front-end development to find out what obstacles one could face during learning fornt-end engineering.<br />
															&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many things could be added to the products; however, just like STP, part of my job as an associate PM is to figure out the priorty and create values which fitted our TA and cpmpany's positioning. 
																<p style="text-align: center;">
																	<img class="elements_img" src="images/customer_focus.png">
																</p>
															</li>
															<li> Communication <br />
															&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Communication couldn't be over emphasized as the most improtant skill of PM. There were other stakeholders regarding products that I needed to communicate with. For example, the instructor might not want to add or change content while some extra information or more detailed explanation might be significantly helpful. My supervisor might have a three-day deadline while the instructor wanted to revise the content, which took more than that. Communication was really important beacuse there was always trade-off between budget, time and interests among stakeholders.</li>
															<li> Constantly Review & Test <br />
															&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It took weeks or even months to build a new course. It would be too late to find out the problems until it was almost done. I had to communicate with instructors before we made videos to share vision about what we expected. Also, I let my friends or colleagues try some of the features during development process to have some responses. It was important to check if we did it in the right way during the process. Constantly review was definitely necessary.

													<ul>
														<p>Challenges</p>
															<ul class="Challenges">
																<li>- No Experience in Mahjong<br />
																&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had to help design backstage of mahjong game while I hadn't played it before.</li>
																<li>- Uncertain Revenue Model<br />
																&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I needed to figure out how to attract and gain dealers with easy-understanding model.</li>
															</ul>
														<li class="sub_title">Revenue model design</li>
														<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our business model was using <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1WRC_psxTxnt4a4g6r57ZrNB1M-VVL--f">"Player Room"</a> mechanism to achieve viral marketing among mahjong players, and selling "Room Card" to create revenue. Main competitors, such as <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.gamesofa.com/mj/">"神來也"</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.gametower.com.tw/Games/FreePlay/Mj/star31/">“明星三缺一”</a>, were featuring quick match game. However, there were players seeking more "realistic" playing experience and preferring to play with friends instead of computer players.<br />  
														&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With some <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1kUGPUlWjunFlwtjZrGurBsZy80oXO11S">market surveys</a>, those highly addicted players were 40~50 and had strong networks among their friends, who also played mahjong. Thus, I targeted those players and tried to design a revenue model that would fit our business model.<br />
														&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were two primary designs, multilevel direct selling and pyramid structure.
														</p><br />		
															<p class="inner_content">
																<p style="text-align: center;">
																	<img class="elements_img" src="images/dealer_structure.png">
																</p>
																<ol>
																	<li>Multilevel direct selling<br />
																	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This mechanism is familiar to many people in Taiwan. The bonus sound attractive. However, there were problems along with its benefits. 
																		<ul style="margin-top: 10px">
																			<li>Agents might stockpile game cards and cause unstable cash flow.</li>
																			<li>Direct selling had had bad reputation and been associated with fraud.</li>
																			<li>Backstage would be more complicated due to different bonus calculation between multiple-level structure.</li>	
																		</ul>				
																	</li>
																	<li>Dealer pyramid<br />
																	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This structure was better fitted to our business model. We generally divided our structure into three layers. The bottom were agents, who bought room cards from dealers or company, if there were no corresponding dealers. The middle layer were dealers, who took greater discount from company and sold game cards to agents.<br />
																	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To make this easier to understand, we simply used "gold dealer" and "silver dealer" to represent agent and dealer mentioned above.By this structure, there were some benefits.
																		<ul style="margin-top: 10px">
																			<li>Dealers of each stage could focus on their roles.<br />
																			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
																			Silver dealers have more margin profits; however, they have to deal with customer issues and act like CSRs. Because players(end-users) are their income sources, they would focus on how to attract more players or stimulate more consumption.<br />  
																			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
																			On the other hand, gold dealers' profits come from play cards sold to silver dealers. Thus, they would focus on how to promote more players to become silver dealers. Because gold dealers got to be silver dealers at the first place, they know what kind of problems silver dealers could encounter and act like mentors.   
																			</li>
																			<li>Dealers can chose their position<br />
																			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dealers have to meet certain requirments to go to upper stage. However, we concern that some dealers may prefer and suit particular stage than others. Thus, we allow dealers that is qualified to stay at their original stage. This mechanism help every dealer to perform better. For example, one could be qualified to move from silver dealer to golden, which spends much less time and effort to deal with players. However, if the dealer is passionate about developing new players, he could chose not to become golden dealer.  
																			</li>
																			<li>Backstage would be more simple.<br />
																			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We didn't have mcuh time to modify the backstage structure. By adopting pyramid structure, our backstage would be simple for dealer. They can view how many cards are in stock, how many cards have been sold to whom within specific duration. Dealers just need to buy cards from upper dealer and control their stocks. Their profit is easy to calculate. This is a benefit for not only dealers but also the company.
																			</li>
																			<li>Avoild stocking<br />
																			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In traditional direct selling structure, since the bonus is given once the product is sold by downlines, some would even force thier downlines to stock products, or even create downlines that are actually themselves. By contrast, because dealers' profit is gain by margin between cost and revenue, there would be no way to create additional profit by stocking products. This also helps us to have a better control of selling operation. 
																			</li>	

																		</ul>		
																	</li>
																</ol>
															</p>
										
														<li class="sub_title">Backstage Design</li>
														<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After surveying our target audience, we realized must of them were at the age between 40~45. Taking the user experience into consideraton, I designed the backstage buttons to provide necessary functions as less confussion as possible. The original backstage had 27 buttons for dealers. I managed to reduce to 18. It was not just downsizing the framework but also being aware of what users, including administrator and dealers, might need. It took many steps to come up with final solution.</p>

														<p class="inner_content">
															<ol>
																<li>What business goals do stakeholders concern?<br />
																&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just like data science, in which the first step is to understand the purpose of collecting data, the fisrt step of designing what buttons were needed was to list crucial business goals with priority.</li><br />
																<li>What methods are used to help gaining insights and decision making?<br />
																&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After listing the business goals being concerned, the next step was figuring out what kinds of methods could help stakeholders with decision making to achieve certain business goals.
																</li><br />
																<li>What data are required<br />
																&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last step before designing buttons was to think over what kinds of data were required for those methods.<br /></li>
																<p style="text-align: center;">
																	<img class="elements_img" src="images/button_design.png">
																</p>
																<ul style="margin-top: 10px">
																	<p>Take one example: For golden dealers</p>
																	<li>Find out the main customers(silver dealer)<br />
																	> Accumulated purchase amount of silver dealers within specific duration<br /> 
																	> List sorted by number of cards purchased by silver dealers with duration selection<br />										
																	> Button【 Selling Detail 】<br />
																		<ul class="Challenges" style="margin-bottom: 5px;">
																			<li>Selector: time duration
																			</li>
																			<li>Output: silver dealer's ID, number of cards purchased, consumption percentage, number of cards consumed 
																			</li>	
																			<li>Filter: number of cards purchased, consumption percentage
																			</li>
																		</ul>
																	</li>
																	<li>Solve the stocking issue for silver dealers if there is one.<br /> 
																	> The consumption amount compared to purchase amount<br />  
																	> List sorted by consumption percentage within specific duration.<br />
																	> Button【 Selling Detail 】<br />		
																	</li><br />
																	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the【 Selling Detail 】button above, it came through a series of process. At first, there were two buttons related to each purpose; however, we found out the table could be combined. There were other buttons for checking the general selling situation or with specified silver dealer.
																	</p>
																</ul>	
															</ol>	
														</p>
													</ul>													
												</li>
												<li><h5>Business Development</h5>
													<ul>
														<li class="sub_title">Physical Channel Development</li>
														<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We had roughly surveyed our TA, who preferred physical to virtual playing experience. I came up with an idea to cooperate with board game stores and table game stores, where the players are mostly close friends, that perfectly fitted our TA's characteristics. Stores could chose to be our dealers or simply promoted our games with special QR code we gave to them. Each QR code was unique, so we could track the number of players from every store. Also, we gave bonus to those reaching certain number of monthly users. </p>		
													 	<li class="sub_title">Line Group Strategy</li>
														<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our game was first lunched for free and downloaded  with APK. We thought using line group would be a good strategy to promote our product. There were some reasons:
															<ul>
																<li>Easy To Use & Management<br />
																&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Line was the most widely used communication APP among our TA. By running line group, silver dealers could teach new players how to download and play. As the same time, silver dealers could hold some activities on their own. Other benefits include dealers could directly respond to any issue raised by players.    
																</li>
																<li>Test & Feedback<br />
																&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before we went online and charged, we collected feedback and tested if their was any bug. As mentioned, our silver dealers could help collect and sort the feedbacks and passed to us.
																</li>
																<li>Viral Marketing<br />
																&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Players could invite their friends into line group. Thus, we built new connections between original relationships. Players would talk and share their playing experience with others and become friends in our line group. This mechanism increased engagement and acted like viral marketing. People kept inviting their friends and built new relationships.

												<li><h5>Finance</h5>
													<ul>
														<li class="sub_title">Budgeting</li>
														<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Developing annual budgets without previos finance data meant we had to come to consensus of annual business plan and estimate related operating activities in collaboration with the development department or other parties included in annual plan. For example, business development department might have planned to join five exhibitions. Only if we had a clear roadmap of what we were going to do and how we would going to make it, we could estimate revenue and cost based on those activities.  
														<br /><br />
														<ol>
															<li>Revenue and cost estimation 
																<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This came with three parts; fist, the revenue estimation. This relatively denpended on annual activities more directly than cost and expense estimation. However, this might be the hardest part because it was hard to precisely tell the revenue every activity or project could bring. Thus, we came up with a range of prediction under different circumstances.<br />
																&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the interaction of cost and revenue, which mainly focused on direct costs coming along with revenue, such as direct materials and direct wages expense.<br />
																&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third, other operating expense. This included two parts, the indirect costs related to revenue generating activities and normal operating expense. The normal operating expense was nearly fixed, and the indirect costs were estimated to be ratio of direct costs.<br /><br />
																&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this stage, we had different annual finance predictions with different scenarios. We selected one according to executability, desirability and variation possibituy as our annual budget base.</p><br /> 
															</li>

															<li>Risk control
																<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the most fatal issue in not only corporate finance, but also individual financial decision is that rasing budget or investment even when the performance is not as well as expected, "The Gambler's Fallacy" so called. To avoid getting into that problem, we carefully gave each project a range of budget increment based on the performance.<br />
																&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, we planned to develop measurement module with 400 labor hours and ready to be deployed on our AOI system, and we thought this development project was important so we gave a 20% tolerance. If we had spent 200 hours with 45% job down, this would be acceptable to raise labor hour budget within the boundary we set.<br /> 
																&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, if the project was way beyond our predetermination, we had to shut it down. Of course that meant wasting money and resources with nothing in return. Thus, a well conducted accounting operation was required to help us spot any potential risk from scratch.
																</p><br />
															</li>
															
															<li>Budget Adjustment and Identifying Opportunities
																<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another part of budgeting is making adjustment after a period. I reviewed our spending based on performance and compared them to budget. Sometimes, it was simply underperformed. However, if the spending of similar activities or projects were all over budget, we had to make adjustment toward next period's budgeting.<br />
																&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the utilities expense was correlated with labor hours with certain ratio, which meant using labor hour as allocation bases was not a problem. However, if the utilities expenses were all much higher than budgets under different labor hours, we must recalculate the indirect cost rate to adjust our budgeting. On the other hand, if there were expenses less than budgets without affecting operating performance, it might indicate there was excess capacity.</p>
															</li>
														</ol>

														<li class="sub_title">Accounting</li>
														<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
														Technical know-how, finance, team and management, marketing may be the most crucial elements for a startup. Finanacial management and budgeting play an important role, especially when the cash flow is unstable and business model still needs to be tested by market and adjusted.  
														</p><br />
														<ol>
															<li>Book keeping
																<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Book keeping sounds to be the easiest part in accounting area, that's why it is often neglected within startups. However, this is a critical part. Without a comprehensive book keeping, it will be hard to do the next step, like analyzing financial situation, making sensitive analysis or next period's budgeting.<br />
																&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My job was to sitck to management accounting to make sure all financial activities were properly recorded. The biggest challenge was how to recognize indirect costs and how to distribute costs to different kind of activities. This was so important because we often had multiple projects going on at the same time. Knowing how many time and resources were distributed to each project would help track and evaluate perofrmance, and adjust project budget.
																</p><br/ >
															</li>

															<li>Analysis
																<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was a disturbing problem because it was hard to use other companies' financial situation to evaluate our performance. Although we could found financial report of listed company, it might not be the appropriate standard for us. 
																What we did could be divided into few parts.</p>
																<ul class="Challenges">
																	<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Major activity<br />
																	<p class="inner_content">
																	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We focused on major business activites that directly influenced revenue and expense. Because our revenue was mainly generated through diversified projects. We consistantly analyzed our projects' performance and other activites related to project execution.<br />
																	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, we found the conversion rate from exhibitions was better than expected. Although the direct and indirect cost related to joining exhibitions were also more expensive than estimated, the revenue generated from exhibitions was still higher than the expense. Thus, joinging exhibitions might be a good idea for revenue growth.<br />
																	</p>
																	<li>
																	<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Cost structure and annual analysis<br />
																	<p class="inner_content">
																	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With comprehensive records, we could figure out the correlation between each activity. For example, the material, supplies and wages expense regarding R&D would be higher during the month when we had exhibition activity. To be more precise, the extra expense depended on the number of cases under evaluation.<br />
																	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this knowledge, we could calculate the ratio of direct cost and indirect cost correlated to their dependency activities or allocation bases.<br />
																	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This helped us to measure whether there was any unuasual performance and establish more accurate budgets. Take previos example, if the wages expense was higher than monthly average in the month without exhibition, we could check if the development department actually had more cases under evaluation. If the answer was no, that meant something had gone wrong.<br />
																	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We could measure the annual performance. By investigating montlhy income statement through the year and comparing actual expense to budgets, we could find some issues, like the unusual wages expense mentioned before. However, if the expense of particular category was always less or more than predetermined budget. It could mean we had underestimated the expense, or on the other hand, there were excess capacities. This helped us to adjust next period's budgets and make better decisions.<br />   
																	</p>
																	</li>
																
																	<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Critical index<br />
																	<p class="inner_content">
																	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This part was mainly focused on annual financial estimation and important index, such as current ratio.<br />
																	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the data of previous period and analysis results mentioned above, we could arrange our annual financial estimation by using income statement, financial statement and cash flow statement and check some important index to see if we might have cash shortage or other problem.<br /> 
																	</p>
																	</li>
																</ul>
															</li>

															<li>Alternative plans
																<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Planning annual budget and risk control was just basic guideline for the upcoming operation. However, what if the performance was just not good enough to generate necessary cash flow? Should we increase more spending on advertisement and other exposure events, or cut it down? When we planned our annual budget, we had a process kind like decision tree. Thus, it could be our potential plan B, C or more. When the performance was severely detached from our expectation, we would consider changing our original plan<br />
																&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still, all decisions should be made with sufficient analysis. Most of the time we would be more cautious with spending. If the opportunity was not obvious and the profit couldn't be guaranteed, it would be better to stick to budget limitation.<br />
																</p>
															</li>
														</ol>
													</ul>													
												</li>
												<li><h5>Business Development</h5>
													<ul>
														<li class="sub_title">Exhibition Campaign
														</li>
														<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The key of B2B sales is to reach those who have decision power. However, it's not easy, especially when trying to make contact with big corporates. The hierarchy structures of big corporates are complicated and it took time for message to go through. Thus, we tried to find out effective ways to reach key personales, and exhibition was a great option to make direct contacts.<br />
														&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We first searched all corporates with AOI products or in related fields to list the exhibitions they had participated. During this process, we also discovered more information about the<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1fsIKUAnX3vAF1CZrTMAPDFqv6ED3fOxMLc_pHKz-ESk">industry</a> and other <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1LT4aaPWS3GG3bNqpOSmSJPfL9xfAvFU0AT8HOmrbusg">exposure channels.</a><br />
														&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After we listed those exhibitions we were interested about, I went further to analyze the statisitc, such as visitors' and exhibitors' composition, number and purchase probability, and of course the fee and other basic information to chose the best-suited exhibitions.
														<p style="text-align: center;">
															<img class="elements_img" src="images/exhibitions.png">
														</p>    
														&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We started a series of exhibitions since April 2017 and kept reviewing after each time to do it better. We had created more than 500 marketing qualified leads and 120+ sales qualified leads in one year. Even now, our sales are mainly from exhibitions and references from existing customers.</p>
														<p style="text-align: center;">
															<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1w-j07Q18znPQMrcrz_92coluarzP0p4L"><img class="elements_img" src="images/inq_project.png"></a>
														</p>   
														<li class="sub_title">Other Activity
														</li>
														<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides participating exhibitions, email marketing was another nice tool we used, which helped us keep in touch with clients and transfer other potential marketing qualified leads into sales qualified leads. The official website and fan page were also used to generate more awareness and interest.<br />
														&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We sent mails to not only visitors but also exhibitors requiring AOI or automated QC solution. We used web crawler to gather information of exhibitors who already attended those exhibitions and invited them to our booth. Also, we gathered information from HR agency and invited those corporates that was recruiting AOI or QC enginners.     
													 	</p>							
													</ul>
												</li>

												<li><h5>Others</h5>
													<ul>
														<li class="sub_title">SBIR Project</li>
														<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SBIR stands for Small Business Innovation Research program. It's a government-held program to strengthen SMEs new technologies development by funding part of the development project. It's not easy to be qualified because it examines not only the technical parts but also other aspects, such as financial planning.     
														<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Few things were taken into approval consideration, such as innovation, competitveness and feasibility. Thus, we needed to provide a sophisticating planning from technical aspect to tectical aspect. 
														<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After approved, lots of reports regarding KPI and accounting were required. That was a test for me to make sure the project was on the track and every details were properly done and documented. 
														</p>

														<li class="sub_title">Golden Torch Award</li>
														<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Golden Torch Award was another approval for us. It was selected annually to commend well-performed companies, innovative technology and extraordinary corporate leaders. We were lucky to be selected as top 10 potential companies and top 10 potential products at 2017.
